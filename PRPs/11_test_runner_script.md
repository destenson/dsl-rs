# PRP: Test Runner Script for Configuration Matrix Testing

## Executive Summary

This PRP defines a Python-based test runner script that systematically executes DSL-RS tests with different configurations, collects results, and generates comprehensive reports. The script enables automated validation of all features across various configuration combinations and failure scenarios.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Tests must be run manually with cargo test
- No easy way to test different configurations
- No automated way to run examples with various parameters
- No consolidated reporting across test runs
- Difficult to reproduce specific test scenarios

### Desired State
- Single command to run all tests with configuration variations
- Automatic generation of test matrices
- Detailed HTML/JSON reports with results
- Easy reproduction of failures
- CI/CD integration ready

### Business Value
- Reduced testing time through automation
- Increased confidence through comprehensive coverage
- Early detection of configuration-specific issues
- Simplified debugging with detailed reports

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Configuration Generation**: Generate test matrices from configuration ranges
2. **Test Execution**: Run cargo tests, examples, and custom scenarios
3. **Result Collection**: Capture stdout, stderr, exit codes, and timing
4. **Report Generation**: Create HTML and JSON reports
5. **Failure Reproduction**: Save configurations for failed tests
6. **Parallel Execution**: Run independent tests concurrently
7. **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress updates
8. **Platform Support**: Work on Windows, Linux, macOS

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Utilize all CPU cores for parallel tests
2. **Reliability**: Handle test crashes gracefully
3. **Usability**: Simple CLI with sensible defaults
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new test scenarios
5. **Portability**: No platform-specific dependencies

### Context and Research

The test runner needs to handle Rust/Cargo specifics and GStreamer requirements while being platform-agnostic.

### List of tasks to be completed to fulfill the PRP in the order they should be completed

```yaml
Task 1:
CREATE scripts/test_runner.py:
  - MAIN entry point with CLI argument parsing
  - LOAD configuration from YAML/JSON
  - ORCHESTRATE test execution
  - GENERATE final reports

Task 2:
CREATE scripts/lib/config_generator.py:
  - GENERATE configuration matrices
  - SUPPORT ranges for numeric values
  - SUPPORT lists for enum values
  - CALCULATE total combinations

Task 3:
CREATE scripts/lib/test_executor.py:
  - EXECUTE cargo test commands
  - RUN examples with parameters
  - CAPTURE output and timing
  - HANDLE timeouts and crashes

Task 4:
CREATE scripts/lib/report_generator.py:
  - GENERATE HTML reports with charts
  - CREATE JSON output for CI parsing
  - SUMMARY statistics
  - FAILURE details with reproduction steps

Task 5:
CREATE scripts/configs/test_matrix.yaml:
  - DEFAULT configuration ranges

  - INVOKE Python script

Task 8:
CREATE scripts/run_all_tests.ps1:
  - POWERSHELL wrapper for Windows
  - SET environment variables
  - CHECK prerequisites
  - INVOKE Python script

Task 9:
CREATE scripts/requirements.txt:
  - PYTHON dependencies
  - VERSION constraints
  - OPTIONAL packages for enhanced features

Task 10:

  - USAGE instructions
  - CONFIGURATION examples
  - TROUBLESHOOTING guide
  - CI/CD integration steps
```

### Out of Scope
- GUI for test runner
- Real-time streaming of results
- Test generation from specifications
- Cloud-based test execution

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Script runs all existing tests successfully
- [ ] Configuration matrix generates valid combinations
- [ ] HTML report clearly shows pass/fail status
- [ ] Failed tests can be re-run with saved config
- [ ] Parallel execution reduces total test time by >50%
- [ ] Works on all three major platforms
- [ ] CI/CD integration documented and tested

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Cargo and Rust toolchain
- GStreamer libraries
- Optional: matplotlib for charts

### Knowledge Dependencies
- Python subprocess management
- YAML/JSON configuration formats
- HTML/CSS for report generation

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Platform differences | Medium | High | Test on all platforms in CI |
| Test interference | Low | High | Process isolation, cleanup |
| Long execution time | Medium | Medium | Parallel execution, test selection |
| Memory exhaustion | Low | Medium | Resource limits, monitoring |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Scripting Language
**Options Considered:**
1. Python
2. Rust
3. Bash/PowerShell

**Decision:** Python with platform-specific wrappers

**Rationale:** Python provides cross-platform compatibility with rich libraries while wrappers handle platform specifics

### Decision: Configuration Format
**Options Considered:**
1. YAML
2. JSON
3. TOML

**Decision:** YAML for human-written configs, JSON for generated

**Rationale:** YAML is more readable for humans, JSON for machine processing

## Validation Strategy

- **Manual Testing**: Run on sample configurations
- **Platform Testing**: Verify on Windows, Linux, macOS
- **Performance Testing**: Compare execution times
- **Report Validation**: Verify accuracy of results

## Future Considerations

- Web dashboard for results
- Database storage for historical trends
- Integration with test management tools
- Distributed test execution
- Machine learning for test selection
