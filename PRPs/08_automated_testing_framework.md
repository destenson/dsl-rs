# PRP: DSL-RS Automated Testing Framework

## Executive Summary

This PRP establishes a comprehensive automated testing framework for dsl-rs that validates functionality, reliability, and performance across all possible scenarios. The framework ensures that the robust multi-stream processing core meets its availability and reliability requirements through continuous testing, chaos engineering, and realistic failure simulation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- No systematic testing approach defined
- Manual testing cannot cover all failure scenarios
- Difficult to reproduce complex timing-dependent bugs
- No way to validate 24/7 reliability claims
- Performance regressions go unnoticed

### Desired State
- Automated test suite covering all failure modes
- Continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Chaos engineering for production-like failures
- Performance benchmarking and regression detection
- Visual validation of video output correctness
- Test environments simulating real deployments

### Business Value
- Prevents regressions that could cause production outages
- Reduces debugging time through comprehensive test coverage
- Validates reliability claims with empirical data
- Enables confident refactoring and optimization
- Accelerates development through rapid feedback

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Unit Tests**: Component-level validation
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-component scenarios
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Full pipeline validation
4. **Chaos Tests**: Failure injection and recovery
5. **Performance Tests**: Latency and throughput benchmarks
6. **Endurance Tests**: Long-running stability validation
7. **Visual Tests**: Video output correctness
8. **Network Tests**: Various network failure conditions

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Speed**: Unit tests complete in <10 seconds
2. **Coverage**: >90% code coverage for critical paths
3. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic test results
4. **Parallelization**: Tests run concurrently where possible
5. **Reporting**: Clear failure diagnostics with logs

### Context and Research

Testing video pipelines requires special consideration for timing, resource usage, and visual output validation. The framework must handle both deterministic unit tests and probabilistic failure scenarios while providing actionable feedback to developers.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Flaky tests reduce confidence | High | High | Deterministic scheduling, retry logic, root cause analysis |
| Long test runs slow development | Medium | Medium | Parallel execution, test categorization, smart test selection |
| Hard to reproduce failures | Medium | High | Comprehensive logging, test recording, seed-based randomization |
| Test maintenance burden | High | Medium | Good abstractions, test helpers, documentation |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Layered testing approach
**Options Considered:**
1. Only integration tests
2. Only unit tests
3. Layered pyramid approach

**Decision:** Test pyramid with unit, integration, and E2E

**Rationale:** Provides fast feedback for developers while ensuring system-level correctness.

### Decision: Property-based testing for edge cases
**Options Considered:**
1. Manual edge case tests
2. Property-based testing
3. Fuzzing only

**Decision:** Both property-based and fuzzing

**Rationale:** Property tests find logical bugs, fuzzing finds security/stability issues.

### Decision: Deterministic async testing
**Options Considered:**
1. Real time delays
2. GLib test harness
3. Custom scheduler

**Decision:** GLib test utilities with mock time sources

**Rationale:** Native integration with GStreamer's event loop, deterministic without wall clock.

## Validation Strategy

- **Meta-testing**: Test the test framework itself
- **Mutation Testing**: Verify test effectiveness
- **Coverage Analysis**: Identify untested paths
- **Benchmark Validation**: Ensure measurements are accurate
- **Test Review**: Peer review of test cases

## Future Considerations

- AI-powered test generation
- Visual regression testing
- Distributed test execution
- Cloud-based device farms
- Synthetic monitoring in production
