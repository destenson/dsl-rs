# PRP: Systematic Testing Framework for DSL-RS

## Executive Summary

This PRP establishes a comprehensive testing framework for DSL-RS that validates all implemented features through unit tests, integration tests, configuration matrix testing, and chaos testing. The framework includes an automated test runner script that systematically exercises all functionality with different configurations, ensuring production readiness and robustness.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Basic unit tests exist in some modules but coverage is incomplete
- No integration tests for multi-stream scenarios
- No automated testing of different configurations
- No chaos testing for resilience validation
- No performance benchmarking
- No endurance testing for long-running stability

### Desired State
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- Automated test suite that validates all features
- Configuration matrix testing for different scenarios
- Chaos testing that simulates real-world failures
- Performance baselines established
- CI/CD ready test automation

### Business Value
- Confidence in production deployments
- Early detection of regressions
- Validation of error recovery mechanisms
- Performance guarantees for users
- Reduced debugging time through comprehensive test coverage

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Unit Test Coverage**: All public APIs and critical internal functions must have tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Multi-stream scenarios with different source/sink combinations
3. **Configuration Testing**: Validate behavior with various configuration parameters
4. **Chaos Testing**: Simulate network failures, resource exhaustion, and crashes
5. **Performance Testing**: Establish baselines for throughput, latency, and resource usage
6. **Test Automation**: External script to run all tests with different configurations
7. **Test Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with coverage metrics
8. **CI Integration**: Tests must be runnable in CI/CD pipelines

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Speed**: Unit tests complete in <30 seconds
2. **Reliability**: Tests must be deterministic and not flaky
3. **Maintainability**: Test code follows same standards as production code
4. **Portability**: Tests run on Windows, Linux, and macOS
5. **Isolation**: Tests don't interfere with each other
6. **Documentation**: Each test clearly documents what it validates

### Context and Research

Testing a GStreamer-based system requires special considerations:
- GStreamer must be initialized for most tests
- Async operations need proper handling
- Resource cleanup is critical to prevent test interference
- Mock sources/sinks may be needed for deterministic testing

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ for test runner script
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Docker for isolated test environments (optional)

### Knowledge Dependencies
- GStreamer testing patterns
- Rust async testing
- Property-based testing concepts
- Chaos engineering principles

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Flaky tests due to timing | High | Medium | Use deterministic mocks, proper synchronization |
| GStreamer state interference | Medium | High | Proper cleanup, test isolation |
| Long test execution time | Medium | Medium | Parallel test execution, test categorization |
| Platform-specific failures | Low | High | CI matrix testing, platform-specific conditionals |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Test Organization Structure
**Options Considered:**
1. All tests in src/ modules
2. Separate tests/ directory with categories
3. Mix of unit tests in src/ and integration in tests/

**Decision:** Option 3 - Unit tests stay with code, integration/chaos/performance in tests/

**Rationale:** Keeps unit tests close to implementation while organizing complex tests separately

### Decision: Test Runner Technology
**Options Considered:**
1. Rust-based test runner
2. Python script for orchestration
3. Shell scripts

**Decision:** Python for main orchestration with shell for specific scenarios

**Rationale:** Python provides cross-platform compatibility and rich libraries for test matrix generation

### Decision: Mocking Strategy
**Options Considered:**
1. Real GStreamer elements only
2. Mock all external dependencies
3. Hybrid approach with test-specific elements

**Decision:** Hybrid - use real elements where possible, mock for deterministic testing

**Rationale:** Balances realism with test reliability and speed

## Validation Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Validate through coverage reports (cargo tarpaulin)
- **Integration Testing**: Manual verification of test scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: Compare against baseline metrics
- **Chaos Testing**: Verify recovery behavior matches specifications
- **Test Runner**: Validate on Windows, Linux, macOS CI environments

## Future Considerations

- Fuzzing for security testing
- Load testing with real video streams
- Distributed testing across multiple machines
- Integration with monitoring/observability tools
- Automated performance regression detection
